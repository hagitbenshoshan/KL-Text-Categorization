# Text_Categorization_KDLvsTfIdf
Here we compare the categorization of text using two different methods and compare the results. First we use the TfIdf method which is common. Next we use the information theoretic calculation of Kullback-Leibler Distance as suggested in the paper "Using Kullback-Leibler Distance for Text Categorization" by Brigitte Bigi.
