# Text_Categorization_KDLvsTfIdf
Here we compare the categorization of text using two different methods and compare the results. First we use the tf-idf method which is commonly used. Next we use the information theoretic calculation of Kullback-Leibler Distance as suggested in the paper "Using Kullback-Leibler Distance for Text Categorization" by Brigitte Bigi.

This project is made to run on Linux. To run, either run with `python tfidf.py` or `python kld.py`. The project expects `python` to be Python 3. You can also run the scripts `run-tfidf.sh` or `run-kdl.sh` which compile to C; this may be faster.
